## 🔄 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

* Loaded raw customer shopping data
* Cleaned missing and inconsistent values
* Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand:

  * Customer demographics
  * Purchase frequency
  * Spending distribution
* Prepared clean data for SQL-based analysis

**Files:**

* Customer_Shopping_Behavior_Analysis.ipynb
* Customer_behaviour_analysis.html

---

### 2️⃣ Data Analysis (SQL)

* Used SQL to simulate real-world business analysis
* Wrote **10 business-focused SQL queries** covering:

  * Customer segmentation
  * Purchase behavior
  * High-value customers
  * Revenue contribution analysis
* Queries are designed to reflect **interview-style analytical questions**

**Files:**

* Data_cleaning_customer_behavior.sql
* customer_behavior.sql

---

### 3️⃣ Data Visualization (Power BI)

* Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard**
* Visualized key metrics such as:

  * Customer segments
  * Revenue trends
  * Purchase patterns
* Dashboard focuses on **clarity and decision-making**, not decoration

**File:**

* customer_behavior_dashboard.pbix

## 📊 Key Insights (Summary)

* A small segment of customers contributes a significant portion of total revenue
* Repeat customers show higher average spending compared to one-time buyers
* Purchasing behavior varies significantly across customer segments

*(Detailed insights are available in the notebook, SQL queries, and Power BI dashboard.)*
